# F1_quali_comparison
A web app that allows users to evaluate a driver's qualifying performance. Users can compare how well a driver did:
  - compared to their teammate across a season
  - compared to their teammate across all races they took part in together
  - compared to their current or past teammates at a particular circuit
  - compared to the fastest driver across a season
